## FLTK docset
### FLTK documentation as Dash docset

The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX®/Linux® (X11), Microsoft® Windows®, and Apple® OS X®..

[Dash](kapeli.com/dash) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager for Mac. If you are using Windows or Linux you probably want to have a look at [Zeal](http://zealdocs.org/) which is quite similar to Dash.

#### Installation Dash

Just download this [docset](https://github.com/shuxiao9058/FLTK-docset/archive/master.zip) and unzip it. To install it just double-click on `fltk-1.3.2.docset` and Dash will add this docset.

#### Installation Zeal (Windows)

To manually install a docket in Zeal you need to download the [docset](https://github.com/shuxiao9058/FLTK-docset/archive/master.zip) and copy the docset-folder into `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\zeal\docset\`. Restart Zeal and Octave should be loaded automatically.
